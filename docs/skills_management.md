# Skills Management System Documentation

## Overview
The skills management system has been implemented to allow users to select predefined skills from a dropdown instead of entering them manually. This helps prevent duplication and optimizes the database structure.

## Database Structure

### Tables
1. **predefined_skills**
   - Stores a list of predefined skills
   - Columns:
     - `id` (increments)
     - `name` (string, unique)
     - `description` (text, nullable)
     - `timestamps`

2. **user_skill** (Pivot Table)
   - Manages the many-to-many relationship between users and skills
   - Columns:
     - `id` (increments)
     - `user_id` (unsignedInteger, foreign key)
     - `skill_id` (unsignedInteger, foreign key)
     - `timestamps`
   - Constraints:
     - Foreign key constraints with cascade delete
     - Unique constraint on [user_id, skill_id] combination

3. **profiles**
   - Stores user profile information
   - Columns:
     - `id` (increments)
     - `user_id` (unsignedInteger, foreign key)
     - `avatar` (string, nullable)
     - `bio` (text, nullable)
     - `date_of_birth` (date, nullable)
     - `phone_number` (string, nullable)
     - `address` (string, nullable)
     - `city` (string, nullable)
     - `country` (string, nullable)
     - `postal_code` (string, nullable)
     - `website` (string, nullable)
     - `social_media_links` (string, nullable)
     - `timestamps`
   - Constraints:
     - Foreign key constraint on user_id with cascade delete
     - One-to-one relationship with users table

## Implementation Details

### Models
1. **User Model**
   - Added relationship with predefined skills
   - Methods:
     - `predefinedSkills()`: Returns the user's skills
     - `profile()`: Returns the user's profile (one-to-one relationship)

2. **PredefinedSkill Model**
   - Manages predefined skills
   - Methods:
     - `users()`: Returns users who have this skill

3. **Profile Model**
   - Manages user profiles
   - Methods:
     - `user()`: Returns the associated user

### Migrations
1. **CreateSkillsTable**
   - Creates the predefined_skills table
   - Implements dependency injection for better testability
   - Includes error handling

2. **CreateUserSkillTable**
   - Creates the user_skill pivot table
   - Uses unsignedInteger for foreign keys to match parent tables
   - Implements proper foreign key constraints

### Views
- Updated profile view to display a dropdown for skill selection
- Replaced free-form text input with predefined options

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed foreign key constraint issue in user_skill table
   - Changed column types to match parent tables
   - Added explicit foreign key constraints
   - Implemented cascade delete

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Database Design**
   - Proper use of foreign keys
   - Unique constraints to prevent duplicates
   - Cascade delete for referential integrity

2. **Code Organization**
   - Dependency injection in migrations
   - Proper error handling
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Security**
   - Input validation
   - Proper escaping of output
   - Secure database relationships

## Future Improvements
1. Add skill categories
2. Implement skill levels (beginner, intermediate, expert)
3. Add skill verification system
4. Implement skill recommendations based on user profile

## Notes
- All migrations use dependency injection for better testability
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate skill assignments
- Cascade delete ensures clean removal of related records
